# Project Title

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative. The goal is to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the sentiment of a given review based on its text.


## Demo

Here is the [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Manasa1/movie_review_sentiment_analysis) 
## Project Description

The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
3. Model Training: Applying machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes, to train on the processed data.
4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen movie reviews.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and convert text into a format suitable for model training.
## Run Locally

To run this project locally, you'll need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt or install manually)

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
```



## Usage

To use the notebook:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook 'movie_review_sentiment_analysis.ipynb'.
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and model results.
## Model Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text vectorization.
2. Model Selection: Choosing the best model based on performance metrics.
3. Training: Fitting the model on the training data.
4. Validation: Tuning hyperparameters and validating model performance.
## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
## Results

The model achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy, demonstrating its ability to classify movie reviews correctly based on sentiment. The evaluation section of the notebook provides detailed insights into the model's performance.
